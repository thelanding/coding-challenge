# coding-challenge
A challenge for full stack engineers

# Goal
Build a simple Todo app with the following features:
- Signup, Login, Logout ✔️
- Add a todo
- Edit a todo
- Delete a todo
- Mark a todo as done
- Fetch all todos
> A plus if you can implement pagination for the todos

# Boilerplates
- API: https://github.com/smakosh/auth-ts-boilerplate
- Next js app: https://github.com/smakosh/auth-ts-next-boilerplate

# Guide
The interviewer will help you to setup those 2 boilerplates which already have authentication built in, helping you focus mainly on the other remaining features to be implemented. The goal of this challenge is not to build the app well but to observe how you will try to approach to build it and ask you few technical questions along the way.
