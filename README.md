# coding-challenge
A challenge for full stack engineers

# Goal
Build a simple Todo app with the following features:
- Signup, Login, Logout ✔️
- Add a todo
- Edit a todo
- Delete a todo
- Mark a todo as done
- Fetch all todos
> A plus if you can implement pagination for the todos

# Boilerplates
- API: https://github.com/smakosh/auth-ts-boilerplate
- Next js app: https://github.com/smakosh/auth-ts-next-boilerplate

# Guide
Use these 2 boilerplates linked above (which already have authentication built in), to add the remaining features. The goal of this challenge is not build the app to perfection, but for us to see your approach.
